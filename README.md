# EMSX API Code Samples for Python
---

## Overview

These code samples offer developers an example of how to build solutions using the EMSX API service of the Bloomberg API.

Bloomberg's EMSX API provides access to the EMSX platform programmatically. It allows the user to automate operations that would otherwise be performed manually by a trader. 

The Bloomberg API is the generic mechanism that provides access to Bloomberg services such as EMSX API. The API comes in the form of an SDK which can be downloaded from the [Bloomberg Customer Service Center](https://service.bloomberg.com/). 
It is available in two forms, Desktop API and Server API. The desktop solution requires a logged in Bloomberg Terminal to operate, and the server solution, for EMSX API, requires the Trading API Server solution. Please speak to a Bloomberg representative for futher information.

```Note: These are code _**samples**_, and should not be considered production ready.  All samples are configured to use the Beta/UAT service by default.
